## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

To set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/satyam237/gemini-tokenizer.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd gemini-tokenizer
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
    ```env
    VITE_DEFAULT_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key (Note: For production deployment on Vercel, configure this environment variable directly in the Vercel dashboard).

5.  **Run the development server:**
    If you plan to deploy on Vercel and want to test the serverless function locally, use `vercel dev` (requires Vercel CLI installed and logged in):
    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```
    Alternatively, for frontend development only:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
